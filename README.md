# About Me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nick Dalalelis, a full stack cloud software engineer. I specialize in **designing and implementing distributed and scalable web applications** targeted to run in the **cloud** using a variety of **modern programming languages**.

Since the start of my career, I have been an advocate for developing robust commercial quality software, with a focus on reliability, scalability and supportability.  Some of my contributions include the following:

* Big data projects at Bloomberg and HPE
* Cloud infrastructure and DevOps at Verizon
* Cloud based applications at Microsoft

## :heart_decoration: Some of my favorite technologies are:

## Collaboration

I'm always looking to collaborate on interesting projects. Learning by experimenting and sharing knowledge is a passion of mine. At **Microsoft**, I was one of the main contributors to the [patented cloud based applications](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140164480A1/en) project.
