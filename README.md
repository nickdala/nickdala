# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nick Dalalelis

Welcome to my GitHub Profile! I hope you find something here that interests you.

A little bit about myself. I'm a full stack cloud software engineer specializing in **designing and implementing distributed and scalable web applications** targeted to run in the **cloud** using a variety of **modern programming languages**. Some of my contributions include the following:

* Big data projects at Bloomberg and HPE
* Cloud infrastructure and DevOps at Verizon
* Cloud based applications at Microsoft

## :heart_decoration: Some of my favorite technologies are:

## Collaboration

I'm always looking to collaborate on interesting projects. Learning by experimenting and sharing knowledge is a passion of mine. At **Microsoft**, I was one of the main contributors to the [patented cloud based applications](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140164480A1/en) project.

I'm happy to chat and collaborate with others. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickdala/).
